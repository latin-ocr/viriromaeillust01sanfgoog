From a note prefixed to Charrier’s edition 01 the Vrar Bonan we
learn that Oharles Francois Lhomond was Professor Emeritus in ihs
University 01 Ρο110, and lived 110111 1727 10 1791; that he devoted himself,
from preference, 10 the instruction 01 younger pupils, staadily declining
positione 01 greater distinction; that during the more than twenty years
in which he was engaged in teaching‚ the desire 10 make himself useful 10
the young constituted tha happiness 01 his life and inspirad him to 1110
productiori 01 unusually successful elementary works.

In Lhomond's preface we ara told that he compiled from Livy, Vale·
rins Maximus, Florus, and othere, the Vrar Roman, his purpose being
to awalrcn the interest 01 his pupils, while at the same tima he endeav·
cred to shape their characters, by making prominent (100ᾱο 01 valor,
01 mercy, 01 unaelfishness‚ 01 magnanimity, and 01 kindness. A few mi-
nor alterations in the text he found necessary 10 his purpose, auch as the
shortening 01 sentences which were 100 long, and an occasional change
in the order 01 the worda. Otherwise the Latin is substantially that 011110
authors cited. ’
