PREFAOE.

...—--

This edition of theV1n1 Reuss is a response to the growing sentiment
among teachers of'Latin in secundary sehools, that ansar’s Commenta·
ries furnish Latin uninteresting and too difficult for pupils who have just

finished the work ol a first Latin book. The Latin Conference in its
report to the Committee ol Ten said:

“The summoning of the Conference afforded a fortunate opportunity tor
the discussion of an important question not included in the memoran-
dum, namely, what authors and what parts oi authors, should constitute
the reading of the preparatory schools? Thus far, the colleges have in
general left the schools very little liberty of choice. Three authors have
' been named by every college that prescribes set work. Of these three the
easiest, or, as one should perhaps say, the least difficult, is Caesar. Hence
it has come about that the Gallio Wur is very commonly used astho first
reading-book in Latin. Our American schools are probably the only
ones in the world ol which this is true. The choice is an unfortunate oue.
The book is altogether too difficult for beginners; it is too exclusively
military in contente to be generally interesting; its vocabulary is too
largely restricted, from the nature of the subJ'ect, to marches, sieges, and
battles, to afford the best introduction to subsequent readiug3 and, final-
ly, it touches human lile at too lew points to be morally helpful and sig-
nificant. The Conference therefore makes two recommendatione: first,
that some easy reading, such as Gradatim, Eutropius, or the Viri Romae,
beused as a transition from the introductory work ol the begiuner’s
book to the regular reading of a classic; and second, that at least a por·
tion ottho time now usually given to Caesar be taken from him and
given to Nepos.”

The editors oi this book believe it to be suitable for pupils in the ear-
lier stages of study for the following reasons. (1) The subject matter is
in itself interesting. (2) The Latin is not too difficult for pupils who have ¹
been thoroughly drilled in any of the manuale for beginners published in
this country. (3) The vocabulary contains a large percentage of the
words found in the Latin read in preparatory schools, as may be seen
from the following comparison. ln the vocabulary ol this book there
ure 3225 words. Among these are 1725 of the 2565 words in Cornelius
Nepos, 1440 of the 2190 words in ansar's Gallie War, Bks. Ι . ..1v,184001
